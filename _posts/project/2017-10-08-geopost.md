### Description:

GeoPost is an app based around the idea of locally connecting to people through geocached posts and images. Only people around you can see and comment on the posts that you make, and they only last for a set amount of time!

Ever wanted to ask for help in the Computer Science building? Post an image of your homework on GeoPost, and connect with someone who can help you out. Want to talk about your favorite band at a concert? Rave about it on GeoPost with other like-minded people!

*Unfortunately, due to the database being shutdown on AWS, the app is no longer available to use.*
