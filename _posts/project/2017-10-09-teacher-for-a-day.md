# Description:

Teacher for a Day is a game meant to simulate what it's like to live a day in the life of a teacher, as people outside of the field of education are often unaware of what it is teachers really do. In the game itself, you deal with a small portion of what we imagine teacher's deal with: managing students.

Occasionally, students will spawn inside the classroom, and will need you, the teacher to look after them! Talk to them to initiate a conversation, and make sure you select the right dialogue to gain success points, or risk losing the game either through saying something wrong or letting your success bar hit zero.

You can also interact with the computer to put your grades in, or drink coffee, just like a real teacher would (the lifeblood of teachers is coffee.)
