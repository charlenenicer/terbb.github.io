This is a bit of a late post, but my experience at the Vancouver Comic Arts Festival was so memorable that I decided to write it down anyways. After all, it was the first time that I had ever gotten people to play a game of mine.

To give the context, organizers at the Vancouver Comic Arts Festival invited game developers to sit themselves in a section called the "Indie Game Arcade" and allow people to play their games for free.

One notable part of the experience was how many different kinds of people played our game. From parents to kids, to other fellow game developers, all kinds of people expressed their frustration and joy at Corporate Paper Cutting Slave Simulator TM. Actually, funnily enough, the kids picked up the game faster than some adults (I remember a particular gentleman who wasn't quite sure what to do after pressing the mouse button) who did pretty well. One person even ended up getting a high score of 3200, which is absolutely bonkers. Now I understand why a lot of Riot employees are Gold. Just because you made the game, doesn't mean your good at it like other people are.

In the end, I have to say that presenting at Vancouver Comic Arts Festival brought a huge benefit: the critique and feedback of players. Many people gave us awesome feedback on how to improve the game. As a developer, sometimes you don't see the flaws in your game until an outsider tells you. For example, I never thought that the way our game presented the shapes was confusing. A 4x5 rectangle is obviously 4 inches wide and 5 inches tall, right? Wrong, apparently.

Finally, I was glad to be able to play some truly polished indie games, most notably Iron Tides and Celeste. Those were two extremely high quality games and if I had some time to kill, I'd definitely buy both of those. Of course, watching people enjoy playing Paper Cut was also pretty heart-warming. Some guy even dragged over his poor buddy insisting he had to play it.

Special thanks to Jay Friso for letting me know about this opportunity. DASH is legit a fun game. Check it out people!
