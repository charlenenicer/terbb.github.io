In the end remix: 5 stars
Warmness of venue: 5 stars
$40 dollar clickdishes credit: 5 stars

Let's be real here. I was treated like a KING at Eduhacks. God damn the venue was so toasty, and the music blasting on the speakers was dope af. Also, they weren't allowed to give us free food in the venue, so instead we got $40 to nearby restaurants. Ayyy free bubble tea

Overall: 5 stars

Experience:

Like all other hackathons, I departed for Eduhacks in the brisk 'morn. There was one slight complication though, and that was I ended up getting off at Vancouver City Centre and ended up eating TacoTime nachos for breakfast. Would not recommend.

Anyways, I did the whole registering thing and waited for my two teammates - a "smart person" and a teacher - to arrive. You see, I had originally been part of a group that my friend introduced me to, except my friend got rejected from the hack, leaving me by my lonesome self.

Eventually, I found them and we sat down. Turns out the "smart person" was a designer. We start talking. The teacher had already come up with an idea - a game about simulating a day in the life of a teacher. Immediately I go "Oh yes - let me tell you about our lord and savior Love2D" and I start talking shit about how Lua is great and Lua is good and Lua is forgiving and beautiful. I don't think they really cared much for it, but moving on, we decided to pick up two other programmers to bolster up our team a little.

So then we scrounged around until we found 2 programmers. "Hi," they said.

"What languages do you know?" I replied.3

"Java." "Python."

"Perfect," I said. "We're using Lua."

Fuckin it doesn't matter whether u use java or python. Lua is bae.

So we sit our asses down and I'm preaching and teaching the word of Lua to these programmers when we start discussing about how the actual game works. Turns out the teacher was imagining a top-down Pokemon style management game. No sweat. I look into making tilesets for Lua and a dialogue system. 4 hours later - I finally get the tileset in the game, and the character can move. But every 120 frames they lag for a solid 4 seconds. I sweat. Suddenly, this doesn't seem as possible anymore. 20 hours later and the other two are still confused af about what the hell Love2D and Lua is (turns out they were my juniors in Computer Science, so I don't blame them).

"This is bad," I thought. Gotta call my counsellor for a quick sec. "I'm gonna use the washroom real quick," I said.

So my counselor's actually my friend Jen. "Jen, what do I do? I've gotten my whole team into this mess about using Lua. But RPG Maker could literally do everything I' m doing right now in 5 minutes. We're not even close to the other game mechanics."

"Isn't it obvious? Just switch. Tell them earlier than later," says Jen.

I CLENCH my teeth. I walk back to my table. I apologize profusely for spreading the word of Lua.

Thankfully, my team was forgiving about it.

I get back to work on RPG Maker MV and set up the whole project. Problem: a team member has Mac and can't download it.

Shit. I'm thinking oh man, I just got my whole team to switch gears, and now my teammate can't even work on it. What the hell am I doing? The clock strikes 7:50pm or so. I'm feeling way too guilty about shafting my team to do anything. But time is running out, and I knew I had to do something. So I start playing around on RPG Maker. I make the map. I make an NPC. I start putting in dialogue that the teacher wrote earlier. I need to do something. ANYTHING. Whether it's copy or pasting dialogue or re-naming something, I had to do SOMETHING.

My fingers start moving. Bit by bit, my brain cranks into gear. I'm starting up again - I'm coming back to life. I zone in. I leave my two juniors in Computer Science in the DUST. I don't even leave them a github to contribute to (to be fair, RPG Maker is a pain in the ass to use github with). My communication rubber-bands back to the Stone Age, as I reply with little more than a grunt to every question my group asks me.

10:00am. I'm working on the first NPC. Her dialogue works.

12:00am. We put in the tileset. It works. There's a hip hop class. I entertain myself with his dancing for a short time.

2:00am. The teacher finishes some drawings. I put them in along with a plugin. The drawings show upon speaking to her.

4:00am. I program a plugin to display the "success" variable as a bar on the top left. What the hell is wrong with RPG Maker MV documentation?
I put Smashville in as the title music.

6:00am. I script in the consequences for each dialogue - including the student leaving. I take a solid 2 hour nap.

8:30am. It's CRUNCH TIME. I go ham on the code. Students start randomly spawning. You can drink coffee. You can talk to the computer for some reason.

1:29pm. Holy shit. There's still bugs. My brain accelerates faster and faster, trying to stretch every precious second for even a milligram of useful thought as I try to
jam as many features as I can into the game.

Finally, we submitted it. Sweet jesus, the game is actually somewhat complete. At first, I thought the game would turn out nothing more than a walking simulator - but as
I booted up and heard that beautiful Smashville theme song running, along with that crooked looking smile the teacher gave me, I felt at ease. I did my best. Well, I could
have done bester ,but whatever.

The judges come on by, and as usual, we give them the run-down on the game. The teacher actually wrote a whole script for it, which was actually really impressive (I think our presentation definitely would have crashed and burned without her). After what feels like forever, we suddenly get a Slack message - "you've made it to the final presentation."

I'm surprised, but I'm also so tired that I can hardly act like it, but damn. We go on stage. This is the first time I've actually encountered a legitimate presentation about a hack while being judged. The teacher carries. I say a few words, the judges give us some positive reviews, and I head back down with my team.

To be honest, I never expected to win. At most, bronze prize. So when I heard the team announced for bronze prize, my heart sank a little. But sometimes you don't get bronze prize because in reality you get SILVER PRIZE. God damn. Or maybe you just don't get it just cause you don't get it..

At any rate, we WON SILVER yahoo. Felt pretty good to stick it through the end and be rewarded for it. I know what we did was technologically much less demanding than other groups. Still, I'm thankful for the prize, and my team. Maybe I'll pawn the 2nd place medal for a dollar or something.

Lessons learned:
1. If you don't know what to do. DO SOMETHING. DO ANYTHING!!
2. Fail fast. Don't spend time getting stuck.
3. Spend time thinking of a great idea and learn the technologies required before the hackathon.
