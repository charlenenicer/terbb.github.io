  <p>Hello there,</p>
  <p>I'm <b>Trevin Wong (terb)</b>, and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student currently attending UBC. I enjoy making and playing video games!</p>
  <p>Unlike a lot of programmers, I never got into programming too much as a kid. I always thought <em>"why program games when you can play them?"</em></p>
    <p>However, ever since starting school, it's funny how I've slowly found myself on the other side. Instead of playing games, I mostly spend my time creating them.
    I think it's because as a gamer, having played a lot, I've always thought <em>"what if something like this existed that I could play?"</em>
    <p>And now that I have the ability to create those kinds of games, it's been really rewarding and addicting to do so. I hope you enjoy playing my games too.<p>
