# terb-theme

This is my very own custom theme that I built from scratch. Not much else to say. It houses my blog, projects, games, resume, etc. pretty much everything. Built with a copious amount of red because I like red.


## Technologies(?)

Other than Jekyll (obviously), Materialize CSS Framework, Font-Awesome and Google Fonts.
